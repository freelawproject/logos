This folder has virtual backgrounds for Google Meet and other platforms. 

# The current items

## Google Meet

There are several backgrounds in the `google-meet` directory. They are also 
available in the effects panel of Google Meet, if you're using a free.law
email address.

The backgrounds were found on Unsplash.

## Zoom

The backgrounds in the `google-meet` directory work for Zoom too! You can 
set up Zoom before your meeting if you have it installed.


# Adding another image

If we want more images, open background-template.svg, add layers, and do 
exports.

To make them appear in Google Meet by default, they need to be placed into
the shared drive here:
