# Free Law Project Logos

This repository contains a variety of images used by Free Law Project. Logos 
are organized into directories for "projects" and "sites." Projects include 
things like `recap`, `inception`, `doctor`, `juriscraper`, etc. Sites include 
CourtListener, Bots.law, and Free.law.

## Usage Guidance

In general:

 - Follow the guidance in the style guide.
 - Use the most recent version of a logo (most are versioned).
 - Aside from small tweaks like resizing, donâ€™t modify the logos in this 
   repository before using them.
 - If you need a logo in a size that's not available, use the SVG or AI files
   to make the size you need.
 - Do not use any image in a way that would confuse people.
