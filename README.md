# Free Law Project Logos

This repository contains a variety of images used by Free Law Project. At the
moment, the repository is a bit messy, containing some extra images that are
fun or useful. In time, I expect we'll slowly refine this.

## Usage Guidance

In general:

 - Use the most recent version of a logo (most are versioned).
 - Aside from small tweaks like resizing, do not modify the logos in this 
   repository before using them.
 - If you need a logo in a size that's not available, use the SVG or AI files
   to make the size you need.
 - Do not use any image in a way that would confuse people.
